# Django Project PurBeurre

This app lets a user search for a product and suggests similar healthier products. Users can save their favorite product in their account. The product data are collected from OpenFoodFacts(https://fr.openfoodfacts.org/). The app is available both in English and French.

## 1. Requirements :

* Python 3.x (you can install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
* Django  (you can install [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/install/)) 
* **pip** package management system -
* Using a virtual environment is highly recommended - Setup project environment with [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io)
* Dependencies in **requirements.txt** (use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install them)

## 2. Database :
* PostgreSQL is used for this project 
* Database structure implementation : use `manage.py migrate` command
* To update the database use `manage.py db_loading`

In your Django settings.py

```bash
   'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'YOUR DB NAME',
        'USER': 'YOUR DB USERNAME',
        'PASSWORD': 'YOUR DB PASSWORD', 
        'HOST': 'YOUR DB HOST',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
```

## 3. Getting Started

1. Setup project environment with [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io).
2. you can clone or fork the git repo

```bash
$ virtualenv {your virtual env name}
$ source {your virtual env name}/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ cd projectname/
$ python manage.py migrate
$ python manage.py runserver

```
Then go to localhost:8000 or 127.0.0.1:8000, and the app should be launched and usable there.

## 4. Tests

To run the tests, cd into the directory where manage.py is:

```bash
$ ./manage.py test 

```
If you want to know the test coverage:


```bash
$ coverage run ./manage.py test 

```
To get test report and generate report in html file:


```bash
$ coverage report -m

$ coverage html
```
